## Notes
I have done a lot of code refactor in this project. If you are confused, 
feel free to leave a comment!  
Since that I haven't had a SQL Server deployed on my local machine, I use json 
file as a data source. I strongly recommend the MSSQL Contributor use the 
same interface as I do in `JSONProvider`. So that we can enjoy a smarter 
debug process  
I have merged the `welcome.html` into this directory so that we can have a 
beautiful login page
